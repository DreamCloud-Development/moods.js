            What is MOOD.js ?
        </h1>
        <h1 class="text-center text-4xl font-black mt-8 ">
            Why .JS ?
        </h1>
        <p class="text-center mt-4" style='width: 50%;'>
            The first version of MOOD.js was written in Python, but it was slow, without any real-time capabilities, and
            the Audius SDK was not available in Python. So, we decided to rewrite the whole project in JavaScript.

            IDK. React was not fitting my needs, and I remember an advice I seen on a discord server one day

        <h1 class="text-center text-4xl font-black mt-8 ">
            Why Audius ?
        </h1>
        <p class="text-center mt-4" style='width: 50%;'>
            Audius was the best choice, in therm of limmitations, number of tracks, and it's even possible to win prizes
            with projects
            using their API
        </p>
        <p class="text-center mt-2 text-sm text-gray-400 dark:text-amber-800" style='width: 50%;'>
            Any more why ?
        </p>
        <h1 class="text-center text-6xl font-black mt-8 ">
            How dose it work ?
        </h1>
        <p class="text-center mt-4" style='width: 50%;'>
            Using Audius allow us to have less server to pay. And for now, MOOD can be hosted on a free tier of Render,
            Vercel, or Netlify.
            And for now, there is only one frontend website to host. So we can host it easely on a small server, whith a
            bit of help from your donations :)
        </p>
